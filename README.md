TVGuide
=======
I built this as a teaching guide for knockout.js. The idea here is to start by showing what the end result should look like,
without the rich features. Then we slowly introduce new changes to the application that show features of knockout
and how they can be used to build a feature rich front end web application.

Usage
=====
Clone

npm install

node scrape apiKey 

apiKey = api key to api.trakt.tv (if you are too lazy to get a key, 
just look at an earlier revision mine is in there)

node index

Then type start

This will fire up your browser to http://localhost:8000

To proceed to the next slide/enhancement type next in the node console running node index
If you want to go back, type back, start will start you over.

Tips
====

* If you are using this to try and learn knockout, take a look at the source along the way.
* Alternatively you can look at the server\2.html through 6.html and the corresponding JavaScript files.
* If you don't like my taste in tv shows, you can edit the scrape.js file and change the list of tv shows.
* Feel free to fork, and re-use anyway you want.
